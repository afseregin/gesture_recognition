<br/>

<h2>About</h2>
<strong>What is your project?</strong><br/>
A program which uses opencv(computer vision library) and teachable machine(helps make machine learning models) in order to recognize sign language and transcribe it into english words
<strong><br/>Why'd you build it?</strong><br/>
Because I wanted to create a project involving computer vision and this seemed like it would not only be interesting to build but also useful

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>
<strong>FILL THIS IN</strong><br/>
 Summarize your goals, non-goals, and project requirements from your design doc. Make sure to link your design doc here as well.
 
 <h3>Sprint Goal</h3>
-Figure out why the model doesn't work(always returns L) and make it work</strong><br/>-Complete the rest of the program(use the model to build actual english words)</strong><br/>-Figure out how to make spaces in between words</strong><br/>

<h2>Key learnings</h2>

-Nothing ever goes smoothly or as planned</strong><br/>-I learned how to use computer vision libraries(somewhat) (start this, but **come back to it at the end of the sprint**)

<h2>Running your project</h2>
<strong>FILL THIS IN</strong><br/>
How would I, or anyone who comes across this project, run this project? Make sure to include all the steps.
